# How to run the app


If you want to use the app, just launch the file "index.py" in the src folder:

```
python index.py
```

If you want to start from 0, you have to create the database (launch the file create_db.py in the src folder) and remove all the picture in the src/static/characters folder.

```
python create_db.py
```

# Log in

If you want to log in, the default user name is "admin" and the password is "default"

Change the parameters in "etc/config.cfg"
